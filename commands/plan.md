# Plan Command

Transform ideas and brainstormed concepts into detailed, actionable implementation plans with codebase awareness.

## Task
Create a clear, actionable implementation plan from user ideas or brainstormed documents, analyzing the existing codebase to ensure efficient integration without reinventing existing functionality.

## Process

### Phase 1: Input Processing
1. **Parse Arguments**
   - Extract input from $ARGUMENTS (can be a brainstorm file path or direct idea description)
   - If file path provided, use `Read` to load brainstormed content
   - Identify key features, goals, and requirements

2. **Understand Intent**
   - Use `mcp__sequential__sequentialthinking` to:
     - Break down the idea into core components
     - Identify technical requirements
     - Map features to implementation tasks
   - Extract success criteria and desired outcomes

### Phase 2: Codebase Analysis
3. **Examine Existing Code**
   - Use `mcp__serena__list_dir` to:
     - Get structured directory overview
     - Map project organization
     - Identify source folders and test locations
   - Use `mcp__serena__find_file` to:
     - Locate specific configuration files (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)
     - Find existing feature implementations
     - Discover related components
   - Use `mcp__serena__search_for_pattern` to:
     - Search for existing implementations of similar features
     - Find related functionality that can be reused
     - Identify current architecture patterns
   - Use `mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview` to:
     - Map all functions, classes, and interfaces
     - Understand code structure and relationships
     - Identify key components and their purposes
   - Use `mcp__serena__find_symbol` to:
     - Locate specific functions or classes
     - Understand implementation details
     - Find usage patterns
   - Use `mcp__serena__find_referencing_symbols` to:
     - Trace dependencies and call chains
     - Understand component relationships
     - Identify impact of changes
   - Use `Read` to analyze:
     - package.json/requirements.txt for current tech stack
     - Configuration files for framework versions
     - README for documented stack decisions
   - Fallback to `Glob`, `Grep` for:
     - Finding all config files
     - Quick pattern matching across files

4. **Identify Current Tech Stack**
   - Analyze discovered files to determine:
     - **Languages**: JavaScript/TypeScript/Python/etc.
     - **Frameworks**: React/Vue/Express/Django/etc.
     - **Build tools**: Webpack/Vite/npm/yarn/pip/etc.
     - **Testing**: Jest/Mocha/Pytest/etc.
     - **Database**: From config files or connection strings
     - **State management**: Redux/MobX/Pinia/etc.
     - **UI libraries**: From package.json or imports
   - Research best practices for identified stack using:
     - `WebSearch` for current recommendations
     - `mcp__context7__` for library documentation
   - Prepare suggestions for:
     - Missing but beneficial tools
     - Upgrades to outdated dependencies
     - Alternative libraries for new features

### Phase 3: Interactive Clarification
5. **Ask Clarifying Questions**
   - Present findings from codebase analysis
   - Ask ONE BY ONE about:
     - **Scope confirmation**: "Based on existing [feature], should we extend it or create new?"
     - **Priority ordering**: "Which features are must-have vs nice-to-have?"
     - **Tech stack decisions**: 
       - "Current stack uses [X]. Continue with this or switch?"
       - "For [feature], I suggest [library A] or [library B]. Preference?"
       - "Database: Use existing [DB] or add [suggested option]?"
       - "State management: Current is [X], adequate or upgrade?"
     - **Framework choices**: "For UI: [existing] vs [suggested alternatives]"
     - **Technical patterns**: "Current pattern is X, should we follow or change?"
     - **Development style**: "Use TDD approach or standard implementation?"
     - **Dependencies**: "Will need packages X, Y. Versions: [suggested]. Approve?"
     - **Breaking changes**: "This might affect [component]. Acceptable?"
   - Provide recommendations with each question
   - Wait for user response between each question
   - Document all decisions for the plan

### Phase 4: Plan Generation
6. **Strategic Planning**
   - Use `mcp__zen__planner` to:
     - Create sequential implementation steps
     - Consider dependencies between tasks
     - Estimate complexity and effort
     - Identify potential blockers
   - Structure tasks as:
     - **Clear objectives**: What needs to be accomplished
     - **Atomic units**: One feature/fix per task
     - **Logical ordering**: Dependencies considered
     - **Flexible approach**: TDD optional based on user preference

7. **Technical Validation**
   - Use `mcp__zen__analyze` to:
     - Validate architectural decisions
     - Check for potential issues
     - Ensure scalability considerations
   - Cross-reference with best practices

### Phase 5: Documentation
8. **Create Detailed Plan**
   - Generate comprehensive plan document using `Write`
   - Save to: `Logs/Plans/plan-{feature}-{DD-MM}.md`
   - Format:
     ```markdown
