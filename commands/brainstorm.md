# Brainstorm Command

Comprehensive brainstorming session with deep thinking, multi-model consensus, and advanced web research.

## Task
Conduct an interactive brainstorming session on the topic provided in $ARGUMENTS, using deep thinking tools, multi-model consensus, and web research to generate comprehensive, actionable ideas.

## Process

### Phase 1: Understanding Requirements
1. **Parse the topic**
   - Extract the brainstorming topic from $ARGUMENTS
   - Identify key concepts and areas to explore

2. **Interactive Q&A Session**
   - Ask clarifying questions ONE BY ONE to understand:
     - Specific goals and objectives
     - Target audience or use case
     - Constraints or limitations
     - Desired outcomes
     - Any existing context or background
   - Wait for user responses between each question
   - Continue until you have a complete picture

### Phase 2: Deep Research & Thinking
3. **Web Research**
   - Use `WebSearch` for initial broad searches on the topic
   - Use `mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_search` for deep web research with structured extraction
   - Use `mcp__firecrawl__firecrawl_deep_research` for comprehensive analysis of complex topics
   - Gather latest trends, best practices, and expert opinions
   - Extract relevant case studies and examples

4. **Sequential Thinking**
   - Use `mcp__sequential__sequentialthinking` to:
     - Break down the topic into logical components
     - Explore each component systematically
     - Generate hypotheses and validate them
     - Build upon each thought iteratively
   - Set total_thoughts based on complexity (10-20 for complex topics)

5. **Deep Analysis**
   - Use `mcp__zen__thinkdeep` with model="gemini-2.5-pro" for comprehensive investigation
   - Set thinking_mode="high" for complex topics
   - Focus areas should include:
     - Innovation opportunities
     - Potential challenges
     - Implementation strategies
     - Risk factors
     - Success metrics

### Phase 3: Multi-Model Consensus
6. **Red Team Discussion**
   - Use `mcp__zen__consensus` to get diverse perspectives
   - Configure models array with different stances:
     ```
     models: [
       {"model": "gemini-2.5-pro", "stance": "for"},
       {"model": "grok-3", "stance": "against"},
       {"model": "o3", "stance": "neutral"}
     ]
     ```
   - Synthesize agreements and disagreements
   - Identify strongest ideas with multi-model support

7. **Alternative Perspectives**
   - Use `mcp__zen__chat` with different models to explore:
     - Creative/unconventional approaches (use "gemini-2.5-flash")
     - Practical implementation details (use "o3")
     - Critical analysis and edge cases (use "grok-3")

### Phase 4: Synthesis & Documentation
8. **Compile Ideas**
   - Organize brainstormed ideas by:
     - Priority/Impact
     - Feasibility
     - Timeline
     - Resources required
   - Include supporting evidence from research
   - Note consensus points and areas of debate

9. **User Approval**
   - Present organized ideas to user
   - Ask for feedback and approval
   - Make any requested adjustments
   - Confirm final list of brainstormed ideas

10. **Save Documentation**
    - Create comprehensive documentation using `Write` tool
    - Save to: `Logs/Research/brainstorm-{topic}-{DD-MM}.md`
    - Format should include:
      ```markdown
