Command Requirement: Code Quality Checker

I need a command that:
1. Finds all JavaScript and TypeScript files in the project
2. Checks them for common code quality issues
3. Looks for unused variables and functions
4. Identifies overly complex functions
5. Generates a summary report with suggestions

The command should be quick to run and provide actionable feedback.
Should work on the current project directory.
